# Text-Communication-using-Light-Fidelity
In this project we have tested the performance analysis of Light Fidelity while comparing it with current technology of Wi-Fi. We have also conducted in depth experiment and found out results that how the light fidelity's performance vary in the presence and in the absence of external light sources.
We successfully demonstated the transmission of the text using light fidelity in 3 environment testbeds like indoor room with and without light sources and later in outdoor environment. For the synchronization of these transreceivers we set the delay of 5ms on both sides.
